Today is international coffee day. It’s an occasion that is used to promote and celebrate coffee as a beverage, with events now occurring in places across the world.

The first official date was 1 October 2015, as agreed by the International Coffee Organization and was launched in Milan. This day is also used to promote fair trade coffee and to raise awareness for the plight of the coffee growers. On this day, many businesses offer free or discounted cups of coffee.

I have several songs mentioning coffee at my disposal. But we can all be like coffee with our heart: so dark that there’s no mysteries anymore. It’s a powerful stimulation.

I used to go out in discos; I even managed to make time to visit the sea and the mountain. But there’s no doubt about it: without a coffee shop, where would I be now?

You can try other stimulants than coffee but you will always meet someone nice while in a coffee shop. How does a coffee shop help me make it through the day?

## A Bad Obsession Coffee Can Help You Monetise.

I’m looking for inspiration and a good idea to blog about: otherwise I’m losing my mind. Looking for a good idea but this loneliness won’t leave me alone. Might as well find other not lonely people.

I’ve spent time in open spaces and other classrooms. While there’s a lot of charm with those cheap facilities, nothing can beat a nice coffee shop with a wonderful atmosphere. You get to meet busy people trying to reduce the pressure they’re facing.

If you want to create a nice atmosphere, make sure to apply some pressure. For example, I have to find 400 euros during those 2 weeks otherwise my blog will revert to a basic blog with adverts everywhere.

Given the right pressure and atmosphere, you will be able to make money of anything. Don’t you love coffee madly and wanna be its daddy?

## Get Lost In Coffee Like You Did 1000 Times Before.

Recently I was blogging about finding a voice for that blog. I was reading a book about the Syrian civil war and they sold it saying the author had an amazing voice mixing integrity and clarity.

Don’t be shocked if you have troubles finding your voice. It means you didn’t find the right drug or alcoholic beverage to help you put down in words how wonderful life is. I guess coffee can also help you find your voice then.

I drink too much coffee and smoke a lot of cigarettes. I’m not sure I want to be the daddy of all those stimulants even though, if I was, I would make sure this makes me money.

Coffee is incredibly profitable and my trader friend was forced to give up beer for coffee. He was tired of paying twice the amount when we want to discuss things outdoors.

We might be celebrating the international profitable day with a ROI of 5 to 1 and maybe more. Is there something sweet at the end of the road?

## A Simple Powerful Way To Analyse A Profitable Business.

You know this awkward situation: you want to start a business and make money and you start to make a break even analysis and maybe a cash flow analysis.

But there’s a simple yet powerful way to analyse a business: what’s at the end of the road? Is there a drug for your condition? Is there sweetness in the taste?

In this blog, at the end of each post or even at the end of each paragraph, you can discover an awesome song carefully selected by me and my taste.

The taste is simple since I spend my time mostly in Europe, Lebanon and America. I also play the guitar which makes each song interesting for musicians.

## Are There Other Proven Ways To Meet People?

You can meet people in a lot of events, or at university or in the street. As a musician, I met lots of people going to jam sessions every night. But coffee shops remain the cure during the difficult times when the sun isn’t shining.

International coffee day might then be about what you should do when the sun isn’t shining. As we all know, when we were kids and young, the sun was always shining and everything was fun. Until you play your life away.

Imagine a world without coffee. The bittersweet taste of this beverage will remind you that, when you reach a certain age, every victory also has a taste that’s bittersweet.

And this is my final thought about international coffee day: what should you do when the victory has a bittersweet taste? Does it look like a day when the sun isn’t shining?

I guess war is also a way to meet new people. But make sure to remain clean. According to Freud, women decide what’s clean and what’s dirty.

```
[Verse 1]
Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you lie
But I don't sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above

[Chorus]
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

[Verse 2]
Your daddy, he's an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He'll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice, it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food

[Chorus]
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below

[Verse 3]
Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You've never learned to read or write
There's no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark

[Chorus]
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go
To the valley below
```
