Ideally, to win, you have to take the high-percentage shot in basketball. And then you become predictable. Life is about taking risks, and anyone telling you to stay safe will die one day.

Yes, you guessed it, this post is about staying foolish and hungry. Steve Jobs was right, and another world is possible: Justice, freedom, and opportunities.

You might say I'm a dreamer, but I believe we made a step in the right direction with this blog. The world is like a big school where God wants to train people.

But, for some reason, mankind has been badly mistreated until now. I guess that's what happens when your enemy exploits your religion. For example, I'm a Christian, and I know people like to mess with me to see if I will forgive.

Until Tomorrow is not here for me. That smell!

## Are We All Going To Die Or Can We Live Forever?

Billy Joel used to sing that we can be free from anxiety until the bitter end. I guess everyone experienced anxiety at least once in their life. Or maybe not if you're talented.

But there's a feeling we just can't shake: Beginnings. The longest journey begins with a simple step. How confident are you engaging on this path made of treachery and treason?

Because we shouldn't be naive. Lord knows where we're heading. I'd like to say space, but we're still taking baby steps. We still don't know how to go to our nearest star Proxima Centauri which is 4.2 light-years away.

I guess we should find the motivation to live longer and happier. And then maybe there will be a happy end, and we won't need a tissue. And the happy end won't be a cryptic code for an intense orgasm.

## What's Wrong With A Safe Bet In The Long Run?

You become predictable. Sure, it makes sense to bet when you have an 80% chance of winning. But you're not alone. You have to find someone willing to lose.

As a result, the safe strategy would be variation and diversification.

This way, life won't get boring, and become dull and tedious. Security is good, and it's one of the basic needs of humanity, but we need differences and distinctions desperately.

For example, my daily life since 2016 is made of big moments of panic and writing on the internet. It gets monotonous to the point that I've stopped writing on a blog to play poker online.

I even found poker boring at some point because all I could do was think about it. I need money at the moment and I was hoping this blog could relieve me from my financial burden a little.

## Do We Need The Calm And Tranquility Most Of The Time?

<aside class="md:-mr-56 md:float-right w-full md:w-2/3 md:px-8">

People disrespect you. It's a fact, and it's been that way for a long time. When you walk down the street, you can bet people made fun of you without you knowing about it.

So I guess remaining calm is one big advantage over your foes, opponents, and enemies. In poker, they call that tilt when you adopt a less-than-optimal strategy.

Of course, Seal will sing "We're never gonna survive if we don't get a little crazy." He might have a point: After all, in a universe that big, it's harder and harder to understand our place. Aren't we insignificant?

And when you are insignificant, it's like somebody insulted you. How would you react? Would you let it go thinking the universe will take care of that person?

## Is It Sure You Will Experience Gratitude At The Bitter End?

Overall, we know we should try to feel grateful in life. But it's so hard sometimes when nothing is going your way or when all your friends are vanished and gone.

I think one of the keys to feeling less anxious and more secure is diversity. I think one of the keys to feeling more alive is variations. Makes me think of a song by Frank Zappa mocking Santana and his secret chord progression.

What would you do to experience a wide range of emotions instead of only one constant? I know you want to avoid negative emotions, and there's only one positive emotion (joy). When our needs are met, that's all we need to know.

I'll see you at the bitter end. In the meantime, seek pleasure and avoid pain. Try to see the diversity in life like a rainbow. And after the rain comes the sun.

```
[Verse 1]
Since we're feeling so anaesthetised
In our comfort zone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home
We're running out of alibis
On the second of May
Reminds me of the summertime
On this winter's day

[Chorus]
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

[Verse 2]
Every step we take that's synchronized
Every broken bone
Reminds me of the second time
That I followed you home
You shower me with lullabies
As you're walking away
Reminds me that it's killing time
On this fateful day

[Chorus]
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end
See you at the bitter end

[Outro]
From the time we intercepted
Feels a lot like suicide
Slow and sad, grown inside us
Arouse and see you're mine
(See you at the bitter end)

Love has seen your run-around
Who wanna seek you now?
I want a peace
I'd whine out
(See you at the bitter end)

Love's reached his side
Grab this gentleness inside
Heard a cry
Six feet down
(See you at the bitter end)
In six weeks' time
The mess you left
Will end
```
