The track is an exquisite showcase of Alex Turner and Miles Kane's ability to craft a narrative that is as compelling as it is haunting, set against a lush backdrop of strings that elevate the composition to cinematic heights.\n\nThe song's arrangement is masterfully executed; the sweeping strings create a dramatic atmosphere that complements the melancholic undertones of the lyrics. The interplay between the orchestra and the more traditional rock instruments is seamless, creating a sound that is both grandiose and intimate. The enigmatic melody, carried by Turner's distinctive vocal delivery, is imbued with a sense of nostalgia, yet it remains distinct and innovative, avoiding the pitfalls of pastiche.\n\nFurthermore, the production on \"My Mistakes Were Made for You\" is impeccable. Each element, from the delicate plucking of the guitar to the warm brass sections, is given space to breathe, culminating in a sound that is rich and full-bodied. The Last Shadow Puppets have crafted a song that is not only sonically pleasing but also emotionally resonant, a testament to their prowess as musicians and storytellers. The track stands as a highlight in their discography, a poignant reminder of the beauty that can emerge from the reflection on past indiscretions."
