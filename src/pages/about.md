I came into the world in Beirut on the 5th of October, 1980, coincidentally sharing my birthday with both of my grandfathers. This momentous occasion, however, unfolded in the midst of a turbulent period for Lebanon, marked by a devastating Civil War that compelled many Lebanese families, including my own, to seek refuge abroad.

In the year 1983, when I was just a mere three years of age, the relentless bombardments became so pervasive that peaceful slumber became an elusive luxury. Consequently, my parents made the arduous decision to establish our new home in Paris, France, where I have resided to this day.

## The Deceased Exert Influence Over the Living

During my formative years, I would often occupy my time engaged in computer activities or frolicking with my cousins. My father, blessed with three sisters, each of whom had their own families, fostered a strong sense of unity within our extended family, all orchestrated under the watchful eye of my grandmother, a resilient widow.

My early life unfolded rather conventionally until the year 1994, a turning point marked by a traumatic encounter with violence that tragically claimed the life of a beloved individual. This distressing incident catalyzed my conviction that the bulk of humanity's afflictions could be traced back to the time and place of my adolescence, specifically the 16th district of Paris.

In the aftermath of this distressing event, I sought solace and insight in the world of detective novels, which inspired me to embark on my own investigative journeys in an attempt to validate my initial intuitions. Regrettably, the profound grief stemming from the loss of my friend plunged me into a profound state of depression, jeopardizing my academic pursuits, culminating in a narrow victory in attaining my A-levels.

Initially, the decision to remain in Paris was shrouded in hesitation, driven by the tormenting experiences of bullying inflicted upon me by some classmates and educators, coupled with my enduring Mediterranean affinity. I pondered whether the dismal oceanic climate of Paris might be a contributing factor to the prevalence of violence.

However, a transformative sojourn to Los Angeles in the summer of 1998, dedicated to the study of astronomy and concluding with a favorable grade, rekindled my self-assurance. Subsequently, I harbored no doubt that my environment in Paris was toxic and perilous, a place where I had fallen victim to its pernicious influences.

In the year 1995, I serendipitously crossed paths with my mentor, a music teacher and coach, which marked the genesis of my profound passion for music. I embarked on a journey to acquire proficiency in playing the guitar and the saxophone, and concurrently sought vocal training, recognizing that a guitarist with vocal prowess held a distinct advantage in the world of music. My musical influences were deeply rooted in the artistry of Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Frank Zappa, who became my revered heroes and guiding lights.

## An Artistic Individual in Conflict with the World

I devoted my student years to a university situated in the Paris region. Initially, the presence of a predominantly male student body in this engineering institution left me somewhat astounded. However, it's worth noting that my adolescence had been spent in an all-girls school that had only recently begun admitting male students. Consequently, I maintained a selective approach when it came to forming friendships. Eventually, I had the privilege of encountering a remarkable and highly intelligent law student, with whom I embarked on a romantic relationship lasting three years.

My passion at the university lay in the field of signal processing. I was an early enthusiast of the MP3 revolution, and my childhood was marked by diligent efforts to enhance the sound quality of my guitar through computer-based filters and similar techniques. Nevertheless, in the social milieu of both Paris and the upper echelons of Beirut society, it was commonly perceived that a career in banking held the key to being regarded as a serious professional.

To my chagrin, my girlfriend shared this viewpoint and encouraged me to pursue a career in banking. Although our romantic relationship eventually concluded, I found myself, post-internship in signal processing that yielded meager compensation, embracing the path of banking. Upon commencing this endeavor, I began with a junior salary, and it was during this time that my generation was indelibly marked by the pervasive anxiety stemming from the global War on Terror.

For seven years, I toiled diligently within the confines of various financial institutions, often extending my workday beyond the conventional 9 to 5 hours. My determination to excel and avoid monotony led me down the perilous path of workaholism, which, regrettably, would exact a toll on my well-being in subsequent years.

My tenure in the banking sector during the War on Terror era was an extraordinary and unique experience. I persevered for seven years in an environment so fraught with danger that, in the end, the intelligence services reached out to offer their assistance. There was no room for misunderstanding â€“ acts of violence, including rape and murder, loomed ominously close, ever-present and palpable.

## A Life Committed to the Pursuit of Music

Following the culmination of my seven-year tenure in the banking sector, an epoch that concluded in 2011, I made a resolute decision to realign my life's trajectory, directing it towards the realms of music and signal processing, even if it meant making profound sacrifices. I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have mustered the courage to forsake the allure of security and tread a more uncertain path.

Driven by an earnest desire to contribute to the restoration of peace in the Middle East, a region of unparalleled beauty marred by the persistent Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I embarked on a mission. Anyone familiar with the Mediterranean region understands the profound tranquility it can offer, yet it is marred by periods of tumult, particularly reminiscent of the era when the Nazis held sway.

During this transformative journey, I had a profound encounter with what I perceive as the divine, and the existence of a higher power, to me, is unequivocally certain. It was during this time that I was guided to unearth a cryptic code hidden within the realm of music, a code that, if unraveled, holds the promise of illuminating our path into the future. I am presently engaged in the endeavor to decipher this enigmatic code, and I am penning this blog with a singular objective: to dispel uncertainty and illuminate the way forward.

<!-- ```
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well she's walking, through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running round
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams
And-a, fairytales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind


[Verse 2]
When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
It's alright, she said, it's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything, anything
Fly on, little wing

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, little wing
